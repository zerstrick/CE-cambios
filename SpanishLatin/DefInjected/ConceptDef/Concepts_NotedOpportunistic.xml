  <!-- EN: CE: New aiming system -->
  <CE_AimingSystem.label>TODO</CE_AimingSystem.label>
  <!-- EN: Combat Extended uses a new physics-based projectile system. Projectiles follow a ballistic flight path and use hitboxes for collision detection. Several factors determine how close a bullet will fly near it's target:\n\n-Visibility: Darkness, bad weather and smoke make it harder to see the target.\n-Movement: shooter has to lead a moving target. Lead error means the shooter might aim too far forward or back in the direction of movement.\n-Range: shooter needs to correctly estimate how far away the target is. Range error means the shooter will aim as if target was x cells closer/further than it actually is.\n-Sway: Weapons will sway in the hands of the shooter. Reduced by aimed shot mode (reduction depends on skill and sights efficiency).\n-Recoil: Shots within a burst gradually become less accurate\n-Weapon spread: Bullets randomly deviate in a cone (e.g. shotgun pellets).\n-Cover height: Cover obscures parts of the target's hitbox. Can block line of sight for smaller targets (e.g. squirrels behind sandbags).\n-Body size\n-Stance: Downed or hunkering pawns are harder to hit.\n\nYou can get a detailed breakdown by selecting a shooter and hovering the mouse over a target. Given measurements are the maximum deviation in cells/degrees and target/cover hitbox dimensions in cells. -->

  <!-- EN: CE: Aim modes -->
  <CE_AimModes.label>TODO</CE_AimModes.label>
  <!-- EN: Depending on the weapon, your colonists can use up to three different aim modes when shooting: aimed shot, snapshot, and suppress.\n\nAimed shot reduces weapon sway, increasing the likelyhood of hitting a target, but requires two aiming cycles before firing a shot, with the exact aim time depending on the distance to the target. The further away a target is, the longer the shooter has to aim. The bonus provided by aimed shot depends on the shooter's aiming accuracy. A skilled sharpshooter can eliminate nearly all sway by using aimed shot, whereas a low-skilled shooter gains only very little benefit.\n\nSnapshot requires only one aiming cycle before firing, and is ideal in cases where weapon sway isn't as impactful (such as close-range gunfights) or for low-skill shooters where shooting more often is generally preferable to the negligible benefit they'd get from aimed shot.\n\nSuppress is mechanically identical to Snapshot, except it allows shooting at targets that have hunkered down behind cover and are no longer visible by the shooter. While those shots will not realistically hit their target due to obstructions, they are effective at keeping enemies pinned down, preventing them from returning fire.\n\nTo cycle between the fire modes select a colonist and click the AIM MODE button. The button will change to display the currently selected mode.\n\nPawns affected by suppression cannot use aimed shot, regardless of what setting is selected (they will use snapshot if set to aimed shot). Mechanoids and auto-turrets on the other hand always use aimed shot. -->

You can enable detailed breakdown of what influenced this hit chance by enabling it in CE mod settings Misc tab.\n\nWeapons with high counterparry bonus, such as spears, may improve your chances of hitting an experienced opponent.

  <!-- EN: Fully-automatic weapons can be fired in multiple ways. You can choose between single, burst and full-auto fire. Longer bursts have increased damage and can suppress more easily but the longer the burst, the more accuracy is lost to recoil. They also deplete magazines much more quickly.\n\nUse lower shot counts for far-away enemies you want to hit and longer bursts for suppression, close range and clumped up enemies.\n\nTo change a colonist's fire mode select him, then click the FIRE MODE button to cycle through the available modes. The button also displays the currently selected mode. -->

  <!-- EN: Mortars are much more accurate when firing at targets they can see. If your mortar operator is within sniper rifle range of the target and has direct line of sight to it they will be able to direct fire directly.\n\nWhen firing at targets they can't see mortars need spotters or they suffer hefty accuracy penalties. You can check your hit chances by selecting the mortar and hovering over a target. -->

  <CE_Reload.label>TODO</CE_Reload.label>
  <!-- EN: Guns have limited magazine capacity and display their current ammo amount when selecting the gun or its wielder. Once a magazine is empty your colonist needs to spend time reloading. This can take quite a long time for some weapons and consumes ammo from the shooter's inventory.\n\nIn addition to the magazine count guns display their currently loaded ammo type. Different types of ammo can have significantly different performance. It's important to select the appropriate ammo for the enemy you're fighting.\n\nYou can manually order a reload or change the selected ammo type by selecting a colonist and clicking the RELOAD button. This will bring up a menu with a reload command and a list of ammo types in the colonist's inventory.\n\nThe 'Unload' command can be used to dump the currently loaded ammo into the inventory. Ordering a reload with a partially filled magazine will do this automatically. -->

Whenever there is a pawn manning them they will automatically use ammo from their inventory to reload or fetch ammo from a nearby stockpile if they're not carrying any.\n\nYou can select a turret and use the RELOAD button to order a manual reload or change the ammo type for that turret. You can also use the 'Unload' command to dump the currently loaded ammo out.\n\nNote that the turret needs to have someone manning it to execute reload commands. -->

  <!-- EN: Some projectiles can be re-used after they impact something. This applies to such projectiles as arrows, great arrows, slingshot stones and crossbow bolts. Re-usable ammo is initially forbidden, and re-usability follows a tiered progression: stone arrows will break on impact more often than plasteel ones.\n\nIf you prefer to go without this feature, turn off "Re-use neolithic projectiles" in the mod settings menu (Settings -> Mod settings -> CombatExtended). -->

  <!-- EN: Shields can provide protection against projectiles and melee attacks at the cost of being unable to use two-handed weapons. They are divided into two categories: regular shields and ballistic shields.\n\nRegular shields will deflect projectiles impacting the torso and have a chance to deflect melee attacks depending on the attacker's and defender's melee skills.\n\nBallistic shields are large and cumbersome, inflicting penalties to melee and ranged combat but they also cover the entire head area and can be crouched behind to protect most of the legs.\n\nShields don't make you invincible however, taking offensive actions will expose the weapon arm while high-penetration rounds will punch through or damage the shield. Don't expect a wooden shield to deflect gunfire! -->

  <!-- EN: You can have colonists act as spotters for artillery. To do this, equip a pair of binoculars, then order your colonist to target an enemy or a spot on the ground.\n\nAfter a while the target will be marked with a red 'x'. Now select your mortar and order it to fire at the marked target.\n\nThis not only removes indirect fire penalties, it will also use the spotter's aiming accuracy instead of the mortar operator's. Use skilled spotters with sharp eyes to direct artillery directly onto your enemies. -->

This will temporarily reduce the amount of blood loss but does nothing to actually treat the wound.\n\nSelect a colonist with medicine in his inventory and right-click the creature you want to stabilize, then click the 'Stabilize' option.\n\nThe amount of bleed reduction depends on medicine skill and medicine used. Internal injuries are harder to treat than external ones and missing body parts can't be stabilized at all. -->
