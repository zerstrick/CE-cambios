  <PlantBlazebulb.description>Genetically engineered plant designed to yield pyrophoric compounds for use in incendiary weapons.\n\nGreat care must be taken in cultivating these as the incendiary compounds inside the bulbs can self-ignite at temperatures above 28°C/82F, requiring constant cooling to maintain optimal growth temperatures.</PlantBlazebulb.description>
