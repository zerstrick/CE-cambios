  <!-- EN: Mitigation effect on damage taken by a weapon when it is used to parry an attack.\n\nAgainst blunt attacks, this rating is multiplied by 1.5 and is considered as the blunt armor rating, otherwise it's taken as it is as sharp armor rating. This rating is compared against the attack's armor penetration, then the damage is reduced by the ratio of remaining to initial penetration and by a flat 50% factor (e.g: if 8mm RHA toughness weapon is used to parry a 15 MPa blunt attack, the weapon will take 10% of the damage).\n\nThis stat is affected by the skill of the user.\n\nWe suggest to read the description of sharp and blunt armor ratings to find more in-depth info about how the damage is affected. -->
